      <h3>Choose something to track</h3>
      <img src="choose.png" /><p>FuzzyTracker lets you choose what you can track with no limits. Our free text option lets you pick anything from standard trackings like food or sleep to the unusual. Pro Tip: Use an Emoji in the name to make your list look great.</p>

    <div id="record-a-thing">
      <h3>Record day by day</h3>
      <img src="entry.png" /><p>FuzzyTracker makes it simple to record your day. Our colour chart lets you reflect and decide how your day went, no more manually tracking calories or buying expensive unreliable gadgets<br/><br/>
      FuzzyTracker highlights your last entry so you can ask yourself the simple question. Did I do better or worse than yesterday? This technique is commonly used in estimation to improve accuracy without requiring precision. This all means, similar results with less work for you!</p>
